__This standard, HVD-DCAT-AP-NO, is the Norwegian application profile of https://semiceu.github.io/uri.semic.eu-generated/DCAT-AP/releases/3.0.0-hvd/[EUs DCAT-AP High Value Datasets &#x29C9;, window="_blank", role="ext-link"]. It specifies how to describe high value datasets, and how to make the descriptions available in machine-readable RDF-based formats. This standard supplements and thus also should be used together with https://informasjonsforvaltning.github.io/dcat-ap-no/[DCAT-AP-NO &#x29C9;, window="_blank", role="ext-link"]. Only HVD-specific requirements are specified in this standard.__ 

__The standard is mainly in Norwegian. However, in <<Spesifikasjon-per-klasse, Chap. 3>> which requires a certain level of knowledge in RDF, the specification of the classes and properties is in both Norwegian and English.__
